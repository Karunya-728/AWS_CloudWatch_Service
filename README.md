🕹 Amazon CloudWatch ⏰🚨


🎯 Metrics Monitoring:
Amazon CloudWatch collects and stores metrics—time-ordered data points that reflect the performance of AWS resources such as: 
✅ EC2 Instances
✅ S3 buckets
✅ Lambda functions 
✅ RDS databases.
 It allows us to monitor key metrics like CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, and network traffic to ensure optimal resource performance.

🎯 Alarms :
CloudWatch also enables the creation of alarms that notify you when a specific metric crosses a defined instance. 
These alarms can trigger automated actions such as : 
✅Stopping an instance.
✅Terminating an instance.
